## Backstory
Mr.Wyze is an esteemed Magus of the order of “[[Studied Shillelagh]]”. He was [[Toshiro Mitsunara (Scott)]]'s former master and trained him with the skills that he have now.

He owe him 300 Belks for back paid lessons.

He is a kind teacher, while still taking his talents very seriously. While his teachings seemed to be very strange and off topic, Toshi's growth under his tutelage is enough proof of his training’s value. 

He has given Toshi 6 months to pay him back. That was 4 months ago.
