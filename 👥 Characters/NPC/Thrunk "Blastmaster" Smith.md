# [[Thrunk "Blastmaster" Smith]]

A member of the [[Smithworks Company]]. Carries metal fists as a weapon.

Rowdy but generally nice. We first met them with their associate [[Curt Boulderbeard]] on the train to Blackstar.

Thrunk's nickname is "Blastmaster" but he doesn't appear to like it and the nickname is not widely known except for by [[Curt Boulderbeard]].
