## Background
The creator of [[Animus (Chris)]] They were the first of his children. From Animus' first moments of life, they watched him create the impossible, knowing he created them to continue his legacy. He continued to age even as they did not. It seemed that he was giving his very life to create their kin. In total he created 21 Automatons. And then as if he never existed one morning he was gone. For weeks Animus' brothers searched and the world mourned, but they could not get themselves to leave the workshop. You could feel him there. Watching. Two weeks later the astronomers found him in the sky, ascended.
