## Backstory
### Early Life
Son of Walter and Mary Sarnoff, Laramie grew up in a tight-knit flock of peacock tengu known as [[Feather Parade]]. This group is known for their flamboyant personalities and utter lack of self awareness. However, Laramie couldn't be more different. His life is defined by one goal: to be the most well respected journalist in all of [[Enzion]]. Laramie grew up reading the only tengu-published news journal, the [[Flight Log]]. While far from being a household name in the region, Flight Log is a mainstay inside Tengu circles. Journalists such as [[Turner Titmouse]] and [[Downy Maymay]] have published excellent articles for The Log and are personal heroes of Laramie's. Naturally, Laramie dreamed of writing for The Log as a kid. He often wrote his own articles and sent them in, dreaming that someone might read them and publish his work. The only problem? Peacock tengus like Feather Parade have a reputation. How could anyone ever take Laramie seriously when your people are only known for being flashy, superficial fools? The short answer is: they wouldn't. At least not without proving himself first.

### The Gentle Bandits
Laramie eventually landed a job in the mailroom of Flight Log. What an achievement! This was huge for him. While doing his work, delivering mail to the offices people he admired, Laramie often looked for potential inroads to the publishing department. He kept his ears open on and off the job, hoping to pick up leads on emerging stories. One day, he overheard a couple people in the office talking about a group called [[The Gentle Bandits]]. Apparently this group was making a name for themselves by stealing from rich groups and individuals in a unique way. They were apparently pacifists that would coerce their targets into relinquishing their wealth, all while never hurting anyone. Laramie found this interesting and thought he could turn it into a compelling story.

One day, on his way into work, Laramie saw a peculiar job posting on a wall in the center of [[Blackstar|Blackstar]]. It read: 

> Take what's yours! Join the Gentle Bandits! - The rich have kneeled on our necks for long enough. We are a group that means no harm, but are going to take what is rightfully ours. Join the gentle bandits today to bring balance back to Blackstar.

Laramie made up his mind instantly. He was going to go undercover and join the Gentle Bandits. Under the alias of Fletcher McFist, Laramie went to the initiation meeting advertised on the flyer. He dressed the part. Wearing garb he figured was suitable for a bandit and bringing an attitude to match, Laramie fit right in. Everything was going exactly to plan.
