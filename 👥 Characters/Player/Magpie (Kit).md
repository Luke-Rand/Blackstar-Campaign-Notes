## Backstory
The one who recently goes by Magpie came of age in the [[Undersky clade]]. Like most gnomes, her early professions were carnival -- fortune-teller, gambler, pickpocket. She visited all the major clades before her 15th Festival, then spent the next hundred years or so exploring technologies in various undergrounds. She was touched by the Grey after her 21st Festival, and as a result has become more reckless and eccentric (even for a gnome) as she desperately strives to stave off the Bleaching. Her foray into alchemy is her most recent attempt to find new and interesting experiences. Her introduction to alchemy and the wider world of dangerous advancement was brought on by her eccentric uncle “[[Smitty]]”

When Magpie became touched by the Grey on her 21st festival Smitty gave her her most prized possession “[[Frecklam Elmsteer’s Mamajam’n Journal of Dangerous Learn’n - Volume 1]]” a small book full of early alchemical formula that Smitty claims was written by your great great grand Aunt [[Frecklam]].
