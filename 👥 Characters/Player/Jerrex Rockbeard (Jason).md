## Backstory
Jerrex Rockbeard is one of a pair of inseparable Dwarven twins. Jerrexâ€™s twin brother is named [[Jondor Rockbeard]]. They both hail from the [[Ironcliffe]] settlement in Northern [[Enzion]]. Jerrex has always been partial to the local wolf populations in his homeland. He has raised his wolf companion, [[Pebble]], from a pup. From a young age Jerrex and [[Jondor Rockbeard]] would run with the wolves. Others would often wonder if the twins were part wolf in some way. Like many of his people, Jerrex is one with the geological elements. He can identify just about any type of natural formation of rock on the planet. His native tracking abilities come from an ability to see ground disturbances and listening to the rocks. Running with the wolves most of his life, he has also picked up some of their natural tracking abilities. He is skilled with a blade but prefers to use his trusty crossbow. His brother is the opposite in that regard. Jondor disappeared recently and it greatly disturbed Jerrex. They have a special bond that endures across the land. His clan has sent him on a journey to find and recover his brother. His brother was supposed to join the family business in the [[Blackstar]] at the [[Smithworks Company]]. Nobody has heard from him since. Jerrex is tall for a dwarf at 5 feet tall. He has brownish blond hair and tends to braid his beard. His hair is short other than his long beard. He has very nimble hands. He is a great sprinter and can also travel long distances without getting very winded. His eyesight is great and he can see fairly well in the dark.

Has an uncle named [[Jeb Rockbeard]].
