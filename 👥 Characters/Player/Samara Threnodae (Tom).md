## Backstory
Samara appeared in the desert at the age of 8. She was thirsty, dusty, and disoriented. [[Newton Threnodae]], the kindly librarian that found her, loved to tell her the story about how it was a miracle that she had survived.

Newt was a kind, studious older man with a bushy white mustache and furry eyebrows like two bleached caterpillars. He belonged to a secret society of research librarians following the order of Magnus. Newt was in the desert researching “life” outside the former  boundary when he came across Samara, and he originally thought she was covered in dust (she was indeed filthy). Upon closer inspection he saw she was rather extremely pale, and from his studies knew her at once to be a duskwalker child. This could only be an act of Magus’s will in Newt’s mind. Newt vowed to take her in and raise her as his own, (mostly) in secret, to protect her from those who didn’t understand her and feared her.
Newt is thin but not frail. He gives the impression of being healthy and sad studious look. Samara recalls he always carries a book or a manuscript with him,  as far back as she can remember. He is usually well-dressed and his presence radiates a sense of calm and serenity.

As Samara grew up, she was schooled by Newt and the order. Although she often felt an outcast, he taught her much in the way of diplomacy and persuading others to gain information. The order operates in private, and Newt lives in a secluded, large establishment with some of his peers. The grounds have a variety of features useful for their research and studies such as a large library, research labs, private reading rooms, and living quarters for its members. Life outside the former boundary is dangerous, and contact with the denizens is frequent and unpredictable. As Samara grew, it was clear she was magically adept–gifted by Magus, and the knowledge gained by the order (freely available to all who asked) accelerated her powers. Samara acted as a sort of protector when Newt ventured out and used her magic to control and banish the undead when needed, and heal Newt and others when injured. Though she still has much to learn, and is early in her magical maturity, Samara is willful and eager to not waste a moment of her new life. She’s convinced Newt to let her leave in order to adventure, research, and find her true purpose.  Very early in her journey she has been grabbed, bound, and enshrouded by a Blackguard. “Gods damn it…”
