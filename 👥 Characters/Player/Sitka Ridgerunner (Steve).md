## Backstory
For thousands of years, my grove remained undisturbed and unspoiled near the foothills of the [[Shattered Rang]]e. A mountain range East of [[Stoic Crossing]] and north of [[Harperhill]]. Then, the Barrier fell, and the cities grew. From the cities, a scar formed, and traversed its way across [[Enzion]] until it finally reached the edge of my domain. I watched with quiet curiosity as the scar ferried workers from the cities to my woods. However, I was not prepared for what would come next. The workers, seeking to expand their scar, drove their tools into the hearts of the trees, many of which I had known from the time they were sprigs and acorns. Enraged, I emerged from hiding and struck a member of the crew, inadvertently landing a mortal blow, and causing the rest of the group to flee. Lest the “Crewmember” I struck was one of their cherished “nobility”. 

My clan, aghast by my act of violence and concerned of the potential consequences for our community, banished me from the grove. With nowhere to go, I wandered Enzion with [[Androzan]], my friend for millennia, who insisted on accompanying me in exile. In recent months, we’ve noticed a looming shadow on the horizon, growing ever closer with each passing day. Seeking to escape this dread, we board the very instrument of my exile, hoping to put as much distance as we can between us and this threat…
