## Backstory
The first automaton.  Created out of a need, to help craft whatever is needed by the Royal Engineer, [[Magni]].  Humans and robots have their issues, one is a pain to deal with, the other like talking to a wall.  So was born me and the 20 other automatons. No need for sleep, eating, or even breathing.  Unfortunately we were created far too late and we didn't have nearly enough time to learn all that was needed.  We could easily carry out most tasks but [[Tempest Drive technology]] is hard to grasp and truly know, even for us. 
 
The death of [[Magni]] hit us hard, how could we ever hope to not only further our ancestry, but master such a complex technology.  We tried and tried but could just not crack the code, and so they started to leave. I could either continue to stay and hope that some miracle leads me to the answers, or go out and find them.  I managed to get a job as an assistant engineer on the only Tempest Drive train in existence.  I hope it can somehow lead me to the answers I seek.
