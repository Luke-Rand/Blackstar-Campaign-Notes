## Backstory
Toshi grew up in [[Crimsonfall]], part of the [[Gennai Clan]] of Kitsune.  The extended family largely made its living as merchants and entertainers.  At an early age, however, Toshi was attracted to the magical arts -- something his family did not support beyond their natural abilities.  Family is very strong with the Kitsune, but Toshi became a student of the magus [[Learned Wyze]].

He lived a dual life, performing with his extended family in the evenings and studying with Learned Wyze during the day.  Despite this arrangement, Wyze was never a big fan of Toshi, who was always late paying his tuition, often only partially.  Wyze had Toshi hunt bounties to help pay for his training, but Toshi would inevitably buy something pretty on the way back or give his earnings to someone who seemed to need it more.  Eventually, Wyze kicked Toshi out of training and went to his parents ([[Goda Mitsunara]] and [[Tatsura Mitsunara]])  to collect what he was owed.

The ensuing family row was epic and resulted in his parents kicking him out and negotiating for Learned to accept half payment from the parents.  Toshi still owes Wyze 300 Belks.  Turning to what he thought would be his best shot at paying off the debt and mollifying his family, Toshi struck out from Crimsonfall looking for bounties.  He had a little success, but nothing to put a dent in the debt (especially because he can't seem to keep any money in his pocket).  A little while ago, he heard about a bounty for 500 Belks and he's been chasing that since.

With such a difficult story, one might think that Toshi would be bitter and angry, but he's such an incurable optimist that he doesn't quite realize how angry his family and Wyze are with him.  It never really occurs to him that anyone could be angry with him or anything.  Toshi always thinks the solution is just around the corner and is apt to go looking without really thinking it through.  As he hunts bounties, he's been in a few fights, but a part of him is always a little surprised at how hard his opponents fight -- he himself approaches the fight as more of a game than a life-or-death struggle.
