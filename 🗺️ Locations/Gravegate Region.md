# [[Gravegate Region]]

## Magic and Technology
### Magic
Magic is very common, and a part of everyday life. It lights our streets and heals our wounds. Thanks to the development of the Greenworth Academy and its newfound focus on crafting, magic is easily available to those blessed with it, or those who’s desire is strong enough to learn it.

### Technology
Thanks to [[MagniTech]] a state sponsored project that brought the greatest craftsman from all over Enzion we were given Electrical power. Now there are Lightning Trains, and flying boats powered by storms. This has caused a movement where mechanics are becoming more and more common, as are firearms.

## Threats
- The undead
- Wild and old magic
- public greed regarding black dust
- The four Great Families of [[City of Blackstar]]
- The environment itself

## The Environment
In the [[Gravegate Region]] you will find a surprisingly large number of diverse environments. From endless deserts, to the urban city of Blackstar powered by electricity, to the lush and dangerous tropical jungles, and even Dungeons of the lost civilizations of the past.

## Economy and Wealth
It is said now adays. Copper is for change, Silver is for life, Gold is for those who don’t fear death, and Platinum is for those who embrace it.
A few years back the people began to call gold “Belks” after the first true king of Enzion, due to his love of finance, trade, and investment in the kingdom.
This part of the world is very diverse financially, from the Ultra-wealthy Families to the poor laborers in the black dust mines.

## The Ruling Class
In this part of the world there are three great seats of power.

Firstly, there is the Mayor of Blackstar, [[Everett Evergreen]]. Elected as mayor a few years back he oversees managing the city and commanding the “[[Black Guard]]”. The Blackguard is an elite group of guardsmen who are given two orders. Keep the peace in [[City of Blackstar]], and never let anything from the lower continent escape into [[Enzion]] proper.

The Second is the [[Association of Adventures and Acquisitions]]. Due to the nature of those foolish enough to live and work here, the “Triple A” is very popular. There are only two reasons to seek a life in Blackstar, Adventures and Acquisitions.

And lastly, there are the Four Great Families of Blackstar.

- The [[Circle of The Reawakened Barren]]
- The [[Ironmane Clan]]
- The [[Smithworks Company]]  
- The [[Crimsonshore Alliance]]
