- To identify a foe's weaknesses, use the [[Recall Knowledge]] free action as part of [[Devise a stratagem]]
- Gain [[Panache]] but using [[Bon Mot]] or the [[Tumble Through]] action.
	- [[Bon Mot]] is when you launch a quip at a foe within 30 ft
	- [[Tumble Through]] is when you move through the space of one enemy, requires an [[Acrobatics]] check against the foe's [[Reflex]] DC
