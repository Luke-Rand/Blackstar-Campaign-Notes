# [[Squawk!]]

### Summary
Trigger:: You critically fail a [Deception](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=5), [Diplomacy](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=6), or [Intimidation](https://2e.aonprd.com/Skills.aspx?ID=7) check against a creature that doesn't have the [tengu](https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx?ID=240) trait.

You let out an awkward squawk, ruffle your feathers, or fake some other birdlike tic to cover up a social misstep or faux pas. You get a failure on the triggering check, rather than a critical failure. All creatures that witnessed you Squawk are temporarily immune for 24 hours.
