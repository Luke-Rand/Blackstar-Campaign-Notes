# [[Pursue a Lead]]

### Summary
Frequency:: once per 10 minutes

You spend 1 minute examining the details of one potential clue, designating the subject related to that clue as the target of your active investigation. This subject is typically a single creature, item, or small location (such as a room or corridor).

You don't need to know the identity, purpose, or nature of the subject, but you do need to be aware of its existence.

Whenever you attempt a Perception or skill check to investigate a designated subject, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to the check.

You can maintain two active investigations at a time.
