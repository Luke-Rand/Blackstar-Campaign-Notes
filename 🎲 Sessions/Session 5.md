# [[Session 5]]

## Summary
We pick up rested in the rug room.

The northern doors are ornate and the handles are recessed. There's no apparent way to open them.

Se clear more rooms filled with zombies. We find a +1 dagger, smoking rapier, 4 +1 potency runes, striking rune, +1 scythe, +1 composite short bow, +1 pepperbox. We also find more Aeon Stones.

[[Jerrex Rockbeard (Jason)]] is ambushed by zombies while exploring on his own. He is hurt pretty badly.

We come to a fountain that reads "Before ..., there was ...". Quilliam is not familiar with whatever this phrase is.

We find an armor storage room and purchase some armor.

We enter the final room where [[Laramie Sarnoff (Luke)]] discovers that the bracelet he received is actually a cursed [[Sluggish Bracelet]]. This reduces his speed by 5. He also becomes infected as a result. We find a book on zombie lore.

We level to level 3.

## üìù Log

We wake rested in the rug room. We distribute [[Magpie (Kit)]]'s items.

[[Animus (Chris)]] investigates the northern doors of [[New Cattleview]]. The handles are recessed and the door is very ornate and well built. We can't figure out how to open them so we move on.

[[Toshiro Mitsunara (Scott)]] starts investigating the next room by peeking through a window. He unfortunately hits his head and alerts the zombies inside. We enter #initiative.

We get through the combat and investigate the next room. Most items have the symbol of the [[Crimsonshore Alliance]] seared into them. Everything is pristine, as if its a showroom. The only thing that is worn is the couch. In between the couch cushions, there is a dagger with a rune etched into it. [[Laramie Sarnoff (Luke)]] tries to infer what the rune means. It is attached to the evocation school of magic. It is a +1 dagger.

[[Jerrex Rockbeard (Jason)]] was in another room looking around while the rest of the party is in another room. There were 5 zombies in the room, which brings us back into #initiative  order.

[[Jerrex Rockbeard (Jason)]] is critically hit by a zombie bringing him to level 2 zombie rot.

We search the armory. We find a Smoking Rapier, 4x +1potency rune, striking rune, +1 scythe, +1 composite short bow, +1 pepperbox

Back in the furniture room, there is an [[Aeon Stone]]. The stone says "the", but this one is noticeably NOT capitalized.

We go to the food stalls to the West. [[Laramie Sarnoff (Luke)]] investigates the fountain that is somewhat deteriorating. There is writing in under-common. It reads: Before [], there was []. We found a stone that says "was" and is lowercase. Quilliam is not familiar with the phrase on the fountain but says that there are many combinations of [[Aeon Stone]]s that would fit.

We then move down to the next room to the West. It is full of armor that we use to outfit our characters. The next stone we find here is "there"

We move into the final room and enter #initiative  with two zombies. When entering the room [[Laramie Sarnoff (Luke)]] attempts to use the bracelet he received but he found out that it is actually a cursed [[Sluggish Bracelet]] which reduces his speed by 5. [[Laramie Sarnoff (Luke)]] ends up being infected. After defeating the zombies, we find a final stone that says "under". We also find a book on zombie lore.

We all #level to level 3.
