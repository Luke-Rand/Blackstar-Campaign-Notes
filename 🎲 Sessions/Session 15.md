# [[Session 15]]

## 📝 Log

We wake up in the camp at the digsite. 

The stone tablet is more of a large dius. There is a blue stone inset into it that appears to be similar to the large one we found that was supplying water to the town in the South-West. 

[[Samara Threnodae (Tom)|Samara]] translates the tablet's writing:

> Where the breath of the wind whispers ancient tales, seek the realm of echoes where Zephyris prevails. To find the resting place where the deity dreams, first dance with the shadows by forgotten streams. 
> Beneath the moon's soft and silvery gaze, trace the path where the lakes once praised. Follow the ripples where memories unfold. The tomb of Zephyris, a story untold. 
> In the heart of tranquility, where the waters gleam, decipher the reflections, let them guide your dream. Where the breaze tells secrets in a harmonious hum, Zephyris' tomb awaits the journey's sum. 
> But beware, dear seeker, heed nature's plea: for the lost lakes hold the key to destiny. In their depths lies the truth, concealed and wise. Unlock the past where Zephyris' legacy lies. 

TODO: find out what they know about the settlement on the other side of the mountain.

We question [[Tarka Gearspark]], who is their lead engineer. She was the head of the excavation efforts. She is currently repainting her anvil in the colors of the [[Ashen Vanguard]]. [[Toshiro Mitsunara (Scott)]] is going through a barrel of sticks. One STICKS out at us, it is short and a little curved. There is a rune etched into it. It is the crooking rune. He records it into his log book. He then brings his staff down to the stone on the altar and it immediately attaches to the staff. The rain then suddenly stops. Toshi attunes to the new staff. 

There is a single word on the stone. It says "Echoes". The attuned staff is identified as a Nourishing Rain aeon stone staff. 

We then leave the excavation site on the crane. The [[Ashen Vanguard]] general then approaches us. His name is [[Generan Tharok Flamestrider]]. He asks who is our leader. [[Laramie Sarnoff (Luke)|Laramie]] points to [[Animus (Chris)|Animus]]. Animus seems surprised. He begins to thank us for removing the rain cloud. He says that we will tonight have a feast. He asks if there's anything we desire from them for helping them. Animus asks for the anvil, which they immediately offer to us. We also ask about the settlement on the other side of the mountain. He xplains that it is a dwarven settlement. We also find out that [[Warlord Drakthar Firebrand|Drakthar]] is his GOD SON!!!! 

We ask about the other X on the map. They explain that it's another site similar to this one. They haven't explored it yet because the terrain is difficult. He explains that the way the wind blows down from the mountain makes it difficult to traverse. We also convince them to lend us two of their troops to assist with exploring the left region. One is [[Warlord Drakthar Firebrand|Drakthar]] and the other is Drakthorn Irontrack (Clever). 

We mount the anvil on the back of [[Sheldon]]. We then proceed to party. We eat an triceratops. The present the first bite of meat to [[Animus (Chris)|Animus]]. He can't actually eat it so he just presses his face into it. It's a little awkward. The party is a good time. 

Suddenly there is screaming. Hobgoblins are being massacred around us. Some six-legged creature is dragging people out of the bonfire light. But then the bonfire suddenly goes out and there is a loud thud around us. 

One of the creatures blows fire as a humanoid creature appears next to it. It's [[Nathan Gruber]]. He is being orbited by the [[Ruby of Anarchy]]. He wants our stones and [[Animus (Chris)|Animus]]'s heart. 

[[Samara Threnodae (Tom)|Samara]] uses Bon Mot agains Nathan. She tells him the more time she spends in his presence, the weaker he appears to be. That makes him mad, as we start #combat .
