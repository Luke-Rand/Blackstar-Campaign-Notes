# [[Session 13]]

## üìù Log

We pick back up outside the digsite that was marked on the map as the location of the Ancient Weathered Tablet.

[[Quilliam]] knows that there are other "silent gods" in addition to [[Zephyris]]. 

We decide to start traveling in the direction of [[Zephyris]] instead of checking out the Ancient Stone Tablet excavation site for now. 

We find a crate half buried in the sand. It has the symbol of the [[Ashen Vanguard]]. [[Samara Threnodae (Tom)|Samara]] thinks she sees something moving inside the crate. [[Sitka Ridgerunner (Steve)|Sitka]] eventually opens it and finds four bottles containing a thick red liquid. [[Quilliam]] thinks they are moderate quality potions of healing. 

We continue to a more lush hex to our left as we travel toward [[Zephyris]]. While we are traveling in this area, [[Jerrex Rockbeard (Jason)|Jerrex]] is going to take some time to hunt for dinosaurs. With a hunting party, they all track down a dinosaur that they flush out using [[Pebble]].

Hadrosaur's weigh an average of 4 tons. We are estimating that around 40%-60% of the dinosaur is considered edible. That would equate to a range of 1.6-2.4 tons of eatable Hadrosaur meat. [[Animus (Chris)|Animus]] is going to craft a smokehouse to smoke the Hadrosaur meat.

When we continue traveling, we come across a humanoid corpse in the sand. There were velociraptors around it that flee as we get close. [[Jerrex Rockbeard (Jason)|Jerrex]] it pretty sure that it is a hobgoblin corpse. It's symbol is more red than blue, meaning that it's likely [[Ashen Vanguard]]. [[Samara Threnodae (Tom)|Samara]] is actually able to stabilize it somehow. We then heal it with healers tools. On his person we find scalemail, a crossbow, and a shortsword. He has a satchel. [[Animus (Chris)|Animus]] identifies it as a "bag of colding (type 1)". There is already one item inside the bag of colding, it is a case with a latch on it and arcane sigil. The sigil is a symbol of evocation magic. We don't open it for now. JK we eventually open it and they are artilary wants. They are wands of fireball.

[[Laramie Sarnoff (Luke)|Laramie]] talks with the hobgoblin when he comes to. We talk about his group of hobgoblins and what had happened to him. We learn that they are planning an attack on the site of the ancient worn tablet. [[Laramie Sarnoff (Luke)|Laramie]] suggests that our interests are aligned with the hobgoblins and that we could flush out the rival clan together. After a Diplomacy check, the hobgoblin agrees.

The hobgoblin's name [[Warlord Drakthar Firebrand]]. We give him the glave, new chainmail, rations, water and a warm goodbye as he heads back to meet up with his people. We plan to immediately travel back to rondezvous with them and then attack.

We roll up to the excevation site. Both hobgoblin parties have their representatives meeting in the middle as we pull up next to the [[Ashen Vanguard]] side of the standoff. [[Laramie Sarnoff (Luke)|Laramie]] daps up [[Warlord Drakthar Firebrand]]. Drakthar paints red war paint on all of us including Sheldon.
