# [[Session 11]]

## 📝 Log

We pick up on day 6 of our second trek through the desert. We're on the back of [[Sheldon]]

![[Rations]]

It's night time. On his watch, [[Laramie Sarnoff (Luke)|Laramie]] notices what looks like torchlight on the ridge in the distance. In the morning he can't recall what direction it was in.

The next night, [[Samara Threnodae (Tom)|Samara]] notices the lights on the ridge in the distance. 

We query [[Quilliam]] to see if he is aware of who might be moving around at night in this region. 

Commonly found in the area: 
- Barbazu
- hobgoblins
- mantacore
- raptors

We spend a day to explore the area and find a tortoise shell and some crates. Inside one of the crates we find plenty of alcohol. 

At night time, on third watch, [[Laramie Sarnoff (Luke)|Laramie]] and [[Sitka Ridgerunner (Steve)|Sitka]] are approached by [[Franchesco Ironmane]]. He says that he is worried about what might be on the ridge. All of a sudden he runs away with a barrel of water. He is joined by another figure carrying another barrel before disappearing in the distance. They appear to grow as they get further away... Something swoops down and picks them up.

[[Laramie Sarnoff (Luke)|Laramie]] yells out that [[Franchesco Ironmane]] ran away with the water as he tries to alert the party, but Franchesco is laying right there sleeping. Laramie also realizes that [[Quilliam]] is missing. It must have happened at one of the prior watches. 

We continue traveling to the south-east. We see something shimmering in the distance. As we get closer we see palm trees

[[Samara Threnodae (Tom)|Samara]] suddenly heard a voice:
> Those that seek those that seek eternal life, often find death

We get closer to the Oasis and there is water and a building. We think we hear someone in the shelter.

[[Toshiro Mitsunara (Scott)|Toshi]] knocks on the door, a human male face answers. He unlocks the house and leaves the building. His name is [[Mark]]. [[Jerrex Rockbeard (Jason)|Jerrex]] asks him how many toes he has. He guesses that we ran into the people from the ridge. He seems to know all about them. He gives us directions on the best way to get to [[Blackstar]]. 

[[Laramie Sarnoff (Luke)|Laramie]] notices that there is a lot of barrels in the house. He uses pointed question to ask how he came across all of those barrels. The man lies, saying that he's had them forever. Laramie lets everyone know that he is lying. [[Jerrex Rockbeard (Jason)|Jerrex]] tells him to hand over the barrels and [[Quilliam]]. All of a sudden Mark's skin fell off. A giant creature falls out of the sky and into the water.

We enter #combat 

We finish the combat after using nearly all of our hero points. The Manticore falls on [[Animus (Chris)|Animus]] from 20ft up in the air. Animus now moves at half speed until we get to a settlement.
