# [[Session 6]]

## 📝 Log

[[Laramie Sarnoff (Luke)]] recalls knowledge on Zombie Lore. In a controlled environment, Zombie Rot has a 100% mortality rate. The Zombie Rot we have has slightly different symptoms. There are two types of zombie rot
- zombie rot
- stitching zombie rot
	- puts flesh in an amoeba-like state that tries to find more of it's own
		- after host stage, it can't be passed on
		- bodies combine together
		- this is why we saw large humanoids
	- more uncommon
	- more dangerous
	- this is what we have

We acquired some more gear at the store. We debate who is going to carry what.

We make our way back to the rug room to rest for the night.

Magpie makes a few doses of anti-plague lesser before becoming an NPC.

After sleeping, we notice that all the zombies corpses are gone. We then set out to test our theory that we need to set the [[Aeon Stone]]s in the hands of the statues. [[Quilliam]] has no knowledge of the people of [[New Cattleview]] and their statues. 

[[Samara Threnodae (Tom)]] tries to use Umbral lore to piece together this puzzle. She hears just the word "Who?".

We attempt to piece together the puzzle, putting [[Aeon Stone]]s in the hands of the statues.

After solving the puzzle, we hear a loud laugh from the door we came in. The door handles are now useable on the northern door.

As we reach for the door handles, the lights flicker and we are suddenly in a lobby in the same location. There are imps all around us and a tall man. He introduces him as Mr. Phole. His first name is Lou. He offers us to sit down. [[Lou Phole]] is accompanied by four imps.

[[Laramie Sarnoff (Luke)]] asks how long he has been there, he says he has been there for about three weeks. He doesn't know anything about the zombie rot, says it was bad luck. He reveals that he is here to "peddle his wares". [[Toshiro Mitsunara (Scott)]] handles the contracts, reading them in their entirety. 

He offers us some contracts:
- Cryolite eye
	- An eye for an eye
	- you can replace this eye for one of your own. Once per day though, the owner of the contract can cause something to float into your vision.
- Bottomless purse
	- Allows you to buy things for their price. But the owner of the contract can force you to sell a common consumable item at half price
- Immortality
	- We didn't take the time to read this one

With underworld lore, it's pretty common for people to deals with the devil in the [[Gravegate Region]]. 

We end up ignoring him and opening up the northern door. [[Lou Phole]] says farewell and we enter the northern room. The room branches, the left is rocky and unfinished, the right side leads into an unlit chamber. This room is considerably more dusty. There are footprints on the floor, they look like heeled boots. They lead out the door we just came in. We infer that these footprints are probably from [[Lou Phole]] and he was locked in this room. Opening the doors probably released him. 

We decide to head left, on the more uneven terrain. We find ourselves in a cavern with a spiraling path going down to a pool. There is a floating green rock floating in the middle of the cavern. It looks like an [[Aeon Stone]]. The cavern looks hand carved, almost it was excavated to build the rest of the cavern. The water is perfectly clear and very very deep. 

We decide to backtrack and go down the right path. In the other room, we see two rows of what were formerly statues. The only things that remain are the feet of the statues. The bottom half of the room are made of dark tile, and the top is lighter. There are also mirroring statues on the ceiling. There are two lines of 18 statues top and bottom. There is a mural on the far wall. The bisection of the room continues into the mural. [[Samara Threnodae (Tom)]] is somehow certain that one pair of feet on the ceiling belongs to [[Magnus]]. There are some pedestals with three names
- [[Solum Watcher of The Flame]] (top)
- [[Quorst The World Anchor]] (bottom)
- [[Reus The Under Light]] (bottom)

When observing these, [[Samara Threnodae (Tom)]] hears "who?" and feels pain in her head. She also has "Who?" written along her left index finger. [[Sitka Ridgerunner (Steve)]] boosts [[Samara Threnodae (Tom)]] up to touch the statue of Magnus. They aren't quite tall enough to reach. She then goes to the [[Reus The Under Light]] statue. She points to it and says "Who?". Nothing happens. She also reads the aura of the mural, there is transmutation magic on it. [[Toshiro Mitsunara (Scott)]] touches it, and a sigil appears:

![[IMG_4964.jpeg]]

We have never seen or heard of this sigil before. It doesn't appear to be related to any form of magic we are aware of. A light appears when you hold your hand near the sigil, it moves as you hold your hand there. Quilliam records the message and tries to decipher. They do not understand the script, but remarks that it is very intricate. We attempt to piece together the mural. It takes hours, but we put together what looks like stick-like figures holding hands. [[Laramie Sarnoff (Luke)]] is able to put together some words in under-common:
> To protect the purpose of all,

[[Laramie Sarnoff (Luke)]] finds that the statue for [[Reus The Under Light]] appears to be standing in the same way, but is distinctly different in some way.

We head back out to the lobby. We catch up with [[Lou Phole]] as he is leaving. He asks us to deal with something for him. He complains about a former client. They were upset and didn't read the fine print of a contract. He wants us to rough up the client. The former client is after Lou. We ask what the name on the contract was. The name on the contract was [[Commander Periwinkle]]. We wonder if this is any relation to [[Albert Periwinkle -White Tiger-]]. Lou isn't aware of any connection. We want him to remove the curse on Laramie if we seek out the Commander. He offers to sweeten the deal by offering us a hellish glaive. It is a +1 striking Glave worth 600 gold.

The client signed the immortality contract. [[Toshiro Mitsunara (Scott)]] analyses the contract. There are also 50 other names written in blood. We infer that the [[Crimsonshore Alliance]] turned into zombies after signing this contract. 

This interests us, so we go forward with drafting a contract. [[Toshiro Mitsunara (Scott)]] is in charge of creating the document. He does a pretty "meh" job. [[Lou Phole]] signs his name as "Louis Phole". 

He clears the way, we get in position and then a jumbo zombie appears

We will pick up the combat next session.
