# [[Session 10]]

## üìù Log

We pick back up in combat.

After finishing the combat, we try to free [[Pauline T'iscion]] from the barrel. When we get her out, she has a cleanly shaven head. She is wearing her deputy sheriff robes. She reveals that she is surprised that [[Todd Small]] hired us to saver her. She tried to kill him just last week. She decides whether or not she should be mad at us. 

She tells us that [[Shelly]] is actually her tortoise and she is going to use her to go kill [[Todd Small]]. However, she offers us another tortoise named [[Sheldon]] as a trade for telling her where Todd is so she can go kill him. 

We bring Pauline to Shelly, and Shelly turns to her. It's apparent that Shelly really is Pauline's tortoise. 

In over-world exploration, we travel to the west (right) several hexes. 

We get to the hex where Sheldon supposedly is. [[Jerrex Rockbeard (Jason)|Jerrex]] is hunting Sheldon to find him. When tracking prey, [[Jerrex Rockbeard (Jason)|Jerrex]] critically succeeds. We find the huge tortoise. He is bigger than Shelly.

We try to figure out how to move the tortoise without a berry. It isn't going very well. [[Jerrex Rockbeard (Jason)|Jerrex]] critically fails at soothing him and nearly loses his arm. 

We eventually tame Sheldon. We travel up and to the right. Eventually we come across a body in the sand. We investigate the body. It appears to be dead, it's clothes are tattered. It has pristine satchel. When [[Samara Threnodae (Tom)|Samara]] detects it aura, it has a conjuration aura. When [[Toshiro Mitsunara (Scott)|Toshi]] looks inside, it appears to be a blank void inside. We believe it is a bag of holding. 

We decide to test it by putting a piece of soap inside.
