# [[Session 8]]

## üìù Log

[[Animus (Chris)|Animus]] put a bunch of runes on some of our weapons and gear. 

We are in over-world hex-based navigation. 

We emptied out our barrels of wine and filled them with water before setting out.

We decide to head south, hugging the mountains. [[Regiboldeustorgust Blatenoose|Regi]] Doesn't recognize this area.

We wake up after the first night to a lout screeching noise. It sounds bird-like. [[Jerrex Rockbeard (Jason)|Jerrex]] identifies the noise as velociraptors. We know that they travel in packs of 3-5. 

During the second night, something happens. [[Jerrex Rockbeard (Jason)|Jerrex]] is the watch that night, and needs to make a perception roll. 

On the 3rd day we find a tower along the side of the mountains. We decide to take the day to go to it. It is a long stone tower. Hopefully we can use this as a lookout.

### In the tower
We find a half-filled barrel with an alcohol smelling substance. When we get to the top of the tower, there are large claw marks at the top. We head up and to the right to cut the corner on our way around the mountains.

### Further desert exploration

On the night of the 5th day, [[Toshiro Mitsunara (Scott)|Toshi]] finds a skeletal hand sticking out from under the sand. [[Samara Threnodae (Tom)|Samara]] identifies that it is radiating transmutation magic. In one hand, it has a magic compass. On the inside, it has a heart. When you rotate the compass, the heart points in a constant direction (not a cardinal direction). "I will find you, my love" is inscribed on the back. On the front it says "My greatest treasure". 

As we move down and to the right one hex, the compass heart starts thumping. As we move through the hex, the compass starts spinning. We dig down and unearth a wooden coffin. [[Toshiro Mitsunara (Scott)|Toshi]] offers to open it. On the inside, there is a destroyed corpse. It's wrapped in what looks like a floral dress. It is a child. It's hands are covering another compass. On the back side of the compass it says "I know you will". There's nothing on the front. [[Jerrex Rockbeard (Jason)|Jerrex]] suggests that we could use these to locate each other if we get separated. 

We come upon a different terrain, that has some foliage. 

Below us is another tower. At the top of the tower, there is a fire. At the base, there is a hitching post with two velociraptors and a huge tortoise. We call out, and someone points the muzzle of a gun out at us. We try to explain to them what we are doing out here. They throw a rock at us and it hits [[Toshiro Mitsunara (Scott)|Toshi]]. A portly human man comes out to us. He's wearing blue leather armor over fine clothing. he has a large gold star on his chest. His name is [[Todd Small]]. He invites us in. 

He shows us to the top of the tower so that we can look out over our surroundings. 

[[Todd Small]] reveals he is/was the sheriff of [[Dusthaven]]. He says we are a couple hundred miles north of [[Blackstar]] as the crow flies. Dusthaven is a western themed town. It has fallen under control of the [[Dust Born Raiders]]. They took control of the town to take control of their moonshine production. He offers us money OR his tortoise (Shelly) if we liberate [[Dusthaven]]. They are the 

[[Pauline T'iscion]] is Todd's former deputy. She is a monk and is being held captive in the town. 

Shelly can carry 13 people, not including the pilot. She is just over 100 years old. Land tortoises live to be around 400 years old. You pilot her by holding a berry in front of her with a stick. 

We end the session as we enter [[Dusthaven]].
