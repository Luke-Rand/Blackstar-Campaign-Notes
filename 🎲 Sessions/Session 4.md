# [[Session 4]]

## Summary
After the combat with the zombies, we notice that they look like they were part of the Crimsonshore Alliance.

We notice a room labeled "doctor". We attempt to enter but there are two zombies inside. One zombie looks like it is twice the size of a normal humanoid.

Laramie investigates the statue in the center of the area. The name is written in under-common: "Reus The Under Light". It appears to be a dark elf and is holding up a fist-sized coin purse. It is wearing battle regalia.

After killing the zombies we find two elixers in the doctor's quarters. One is an anti-plague potion (lesser). We find another [[Aeon Stone]] that says "The" and is capitalized.

We move to the next northern room where there is another zombie. After killing it, we find another stone that says "Light".

The next room going counter-clockwise is a room with dusty books. There are some plants that are suspiciously thriving despite no natural light. There is another stone labeled "Dawn". We find a grey staff that Toshi identifies as a staff of earth. Laramie then searches the desk and finds an "inquisitive quill" item. 

The party asks it some questions. We find out that the statues are the "worshipers of Reus", the zombies have succumbed to "zombie rot", it doesn't know the significance of the bronze lines on the floor, and it doesn't know who Reus the Under Light is. The quill was on an expedition here as part of a party of 57 from the Crimsonshore Alliance. The purpose of the expedition was to create a settlement. We name the quill as Quilliam.

Floorplan clockwise is: library, armorer, weaponsmith, furniture, rugs, diner, scribe, general store, doctor

We find another stone "Before"

In the rug room there is a silver statue emenating a magical aura called "The Lady of Feline Grace". It is holding a potion known as a "Rebirth Potion".

We end up resting in the rug room overnight, alternating watch. We get through the night without issues but party members need to make fortitude checks for their zombie rot.

## üìù Log

Some of the [[zombie]]s that attacked us looked like they were part of the [[Crimsonshore Alliance]]. There is a sign hanging outside the wooden room in the corner. The sign says "doctor". [[Toshiro Mitsunara (Scott)]] checks the room for traps. As Toshi tries to open the door, a face fills up the porthole on the door. [[Jerrex Rockbeard (Jason)]] thinks he sees an elephant standing in the corner of the room. It turns out to be an 8-foot-tall humanoid. 

Have Austin repeat his description of the [[Crimsonshore Alliance]]'s connection to the underworld

[[Magpie]] hit the zombie with bottled sunlight that they created.

[[Laramie Sarnoff (Luke)]] investigates the statue. Its name is written in undercommon, which is used by underground civilizations. It appears to have elven features. It's not elven though, it has bigger eyes. It could be a dark elf. Every first character in the name of the statue is capitalized. It's name is [[Reus The Under Light]]. This naming convention is only given to deities. Laramie then does a general perception check to see what the artist of this statue might have thought was important. The pose is strange, it is not holding its sword up but rather an item. The item is fist sized, in a bag of some kind. It appears to be a coin purse. It is wearing battle regalia. 

We are eventually able to kill the zombies. There are beakers on the far wall. One containing a green gross liquid, and one clear red liquid. Under the red liquid, there are small single dose vials of the substance. Laramie asks [[Magpie (Kit)]] if they recognize them. They are elixir of life (lesser). We distribute them amongst the party. Under the green potion, there is only one single dose vial. It is an Anti-plague potion (lesser). Searching the desk, it looks like it was tossed over by someone. There isn't anything else of note in the room.

We searched the bodies that we killed in the room. The big one is roughly double the size of a usual humanoid. 

We notice that the T on the "The" stone is capitalized.

Magpie notices that there is a faint green light coming from one of the lanterns. 

In the next room to the north, there is another big zombie creature.

[[Laramie Sarnoff (Luke)]] notices that the statues are all aligned based on the lines on the ground, pointing toward the center of the area where the statue of [[Reus The Under Light]] is. Magpie makes a point that the lines on the ground could be conducting some sort of energy.

The zombies are weak to slashing damage.

We found another [[Aeon Stone]]. It says "Light". 

We set out to search the rest of the area. We find a clean room that has dusty books. The books contain taxation documents. There are also some plants that are suspiciously living down here with no natural light. Kit finds another stone that says "Dawn". They also found 4 scrolls of detect magic. [[Laramie Sarnoff (Luke)]] notices that one of the bookshelves is ajar. Behind it, there is a strange grey staff. Toshi attempts to identify it. He does this by meditating. It is a Staff of Earth. When you stamp it against the ground, it makes a solid thud. There is a desk that looks hardly used. Laramie opens it up and there is a piece of paper. There is a magical quill as well. It writes "hello" on the paper. It says that it is an "inquisitive quill". [[Laramie Sarnoff (Luke)]] asks what the significance of the bowing statues is here in [[New Cattleview]]. It says that they are the "Worshipers of Reus". He also asks why all of the inhabitance are zombies, it says that it is probably zombie rot. It doesn't know what the significance of the bronze lines on the floor are. It also doesn't know who [[Reus The Under Light]] is. It says it was on an expedition of the [[Crimsonshore Alliance]] here, a party of 57. The purpose of the expedition was to create a settlement. It says that it has been here for a handful of weeks. it takes about a week or two for the entire settlement to get zombie rot. How long for the first symptoms to show? two days. It does not know what the purpose of the green stones are. We have decided to take the quill with us.

We have named the inquisitive quill: Quilliam.

We found another stone: "Before"

In the rug room, there is a small statue. The statue is made of silver. Quilli observes it using Religion. it is emanating a neural magic aura. It is a silver statuette of Chamomile Moonbeam "The Lady of Feline Grace". It is worth 25 gold. Quilli believes that the statue is holding a potion known as a "Rebirth" potion. The potion is very valuable. We decide to rest in the Rug Room.

We take turns keeping watch.

No issues during watch 1, 2, 3, and 4. We hear zombies about to pass on watch 5 but they walk by. 

People are doing their fortitude zombie rot checks in the morning. Quilli explains the details of Zombie Rot
