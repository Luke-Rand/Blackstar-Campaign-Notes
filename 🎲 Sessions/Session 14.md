# [[Session 14]]

## üìù Log

We pick up at the hobgoblin standoff. We are on the side of the [[Ashen Vanguard]].

The two leaders of both sides meet in the middle of the battlefield. [[Warlord Drakthar Firebrand]] is looking REALLY badass with all of the gear we gave him. We learn there are three warlords on the side of the [[Ashen Vanguard]]. We are outnumbered, there are more warlords on the opposing side than we could count.

#combat  starts
We launch off a fireball from one of the wands to start. It immediately kills a huge chunk of the [[Sandstorm Legion]]'s forces. 

We got through this army of hobgoblins while only losing one of our soldiers. We then moved on to the second wave at their excavation site.

We win the combat against the Sandstorm Legion

We are now in the pit where they were doing their excavation. We rest in the camp for the night. We improve [[Sheldon]] with the equipment and the help of [[Crimsonshore Alliance]]. [[Laramie Sarnoff (Luke)|Laramie]] acquires Hobgoblin Lore, and everyone levels up to level 5.
