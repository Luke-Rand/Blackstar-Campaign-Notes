# [[Session 9]]

## üìù Log

We come to the [[Last Drop Saloon]]. It is mostly patronned by the working class.

[[Laramie]] enters the saloon, playing the part of a Western traveler. He turns in his weapons at the door. At the bar, there are a large number of barrels. They have "mixed" markings on them. Plenty of stamps and such. The barkeep was scribbling something and hides it. He notices that it is a ledger of sorts. It says "dues". 

There is a table with a nicer rug. They have more important people. 

There are two half-orcs at the bar serving. They serve [[Samara Threnodae (Tom)|Samara]] and [[Laramie Sarnoff (Luke)|Laramie]] some moonshine. The orc says that the important person in the corner is [[Jackson Blackjack McBride]]. All the other people at the table have unsigned contracts. 

[[Jerrex Rockbeard (Jason)|Jerrex]] Is wandering around outside and is stopped by a local. he tries to play it cool and rolls a deception roll. 

[[Sitka Ridgerunner (Steve)|Sitka]] plays cards with some locals. He asks about [[Pauline T'iscion]]. She is being held in the abandoned base across the street. 

[[Laramie Sarnoff (Luke)|Laramie]] stakes out the saloon, watching as people come and go. More bandits enter the building than leaving. It seems like there is a crowd growing.

It gets late. We sneak up to the prison to break out [[Pauline T'iscion]]. We are gathered around the back of the building
