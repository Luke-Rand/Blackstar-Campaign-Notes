# [[Session 7]]

## üìù Log

#combat 
We open up at the fight with the [[Stitched Hulk]]. It is pitch blackness and hard to see.

After one of [[Animus (Chris)|Animus]]'s attacks, a [[zombie]] brute broke off of the hulk  and started attacking us. 

[[Laramie Sarnoff (Luke)|Laramie]] recalls knowledge in [[Zombie Lore]] and learns that one of the Hulk's weaknesses is critical hits. It is immune to everything that isn't a weakness. We also find out that positive damage hurts it.

[[Animus (Chris)|Animus]] deals the final blow the the Hulk, which spawns one more brute.

After we kill all of the brutes, [[Samara Threnodae (Tom)|Samara]] destroys the remains with positive damage.

At the [[Reus The Under Light]] statue we find one final [[Aeon Stone]]. In under-common, it says "Illuminate". We also find the head of a curved staff. There are two inscriptions in it that dictate two runes. This should help [[Animus (Chris)|Animus]] recreate these runes. [[Animus (Chris)|Animus]] recognizes one rune as the striking rune. They will need to take 10 minutes of downtime to recognize the second rune. After some time, we recognize it as the [[Crooking Rune]]. 

Effects of the Aeon stone:
- Resistant 1 to negative damage
- Can cast light

[[Lou Phole]] is now let out of the North room. He holds up his end of the bargain and destroys [[Laramie Sarnoff (Luke)|Laramie]]'s cursed bracelet. He also gives us the +1 Flaming Glave he promised. [[Animus (Chris)|Animus]] notices that it has a Flaming Rune etched into it.

[[Lou Phole]] gets up to leave and we follow him out. We meet the rest of the party outside of [[New Cattleview]]. [[Samara Threnodae (Tom)|Samara]] makes sure to let [[Albert Periwinkle -White Tiger-]] know that his father signed the contract that led to us fighting the Stitched Hulk. Lou gets out right away. 

We are now in downtime.
